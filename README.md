# Banken - a console based bank app
A simple bank app made with C# as an examining project in school.

# This is a simple bank program where you can list your account balance, withdraw money from different users accounts and transfer money between accounts. 

## Technologies
â€¢ C#

## Reflections
This is a simple bank app where you can login with pre made accounts and balances. Built with jagged arrays to set the users, their passwords and account balances. I chose to use jagged arrays since everything is hard coded. The need to add or remove users was not mandatory, then jagged arrays was a more simple approach compared to OOP with adding classes for users and accounts. It could have been a better way which would make things more flexible when it comes to adding or removing users, accounts and so on.
